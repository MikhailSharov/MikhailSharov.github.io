    <p>January 17 - 24: The Pale Blue Dot by Carl Sagan</p>
    <p>Non-fiction, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pale-Blue-Dot-Vision-Future/dp/0345376595">Like to Book</a> </p>
    <p>Admittedly, this is not the first time I have read this book. However I greatly enjoy it. My own passion for
    space exploration leads me to naturally enjoy this book. The eloquent way in which Sagan explains the frailty and
    minisclue impact of humanity is amazing. The awe of the scale of everything is what drives me to persue my career
    and this book sums it up excellently. On top of this, the visions of the future, both optimistic and scary which
    Sagan provides are subjects which matter and should be read about. This book continually inspires me and rightly
    earns its score.</p>
    <p>Score: 4.5 / 5</p>
